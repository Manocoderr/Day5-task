Differences between window, screen, and document:

Window
The window is the first thing that loads into the browser. It is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript.

Screen
The screen is the physical display's full screen. It contains properties about the user's display.

Document
The document is the main object of the potentially visible document object model (DOM). It is the HTML, aspx, php, or other document that is loaded into the browser.
